(2) REORGANIZE LITERATURE REVIEW—restructure from full citation format into 3–4 thematic paragraphs (e.g., 'Touchscreen Ergonomics and Target Size Effects', 'User Populations and Accessibility Considerations', 'Material Design Standards & Implementation Evidence') with brief parenthetical citations instead of full reference details.
